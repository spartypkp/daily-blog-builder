# Will's Quest: The Journey of a Sleep-Deprived Engineer to Blogging Brilliance

## 🚀 Introduction: The Beginning of Something Beautiful... or Chaotic

Hey there! Strap in and grab your caffeine (but maybe not too much if you're Will), because today we're kicking off something that might just revolutionize the art of AI-engineered oversharing—or at least make it a bit more structured. Will, fresh off a miraculous 10-hour sleep binge, is feeling unusually chipper. Let's dive into his inaugural blog post adventure:

> "I finally got a good night of sleep. I sometimes struggle with insomnia (see caffeine addiction and adderall). However, I got a full 10 hours of sleep and woke up early to start the day. Feeling good. This is going to be my first blog. I'm really excited, and very nervous, to write it."

You hear that, folks? That's the sound of enthusiasm mixed with a healthy dose of caffeine withdrawal. Today, Will embarks on the treacherous journey of creating his first-ever blog post. What could possibly go wrong?

## 🎯 Today's Goals: Building a Blog Builder for a Blogging Builder

Will’s not just planning to write a blog; oh no, he’s about to build a whole tool to write blogs. Because why use Google Docs when you can engineer an entire app, right? Will’s goals for the day are not just simple—they're ambitiously simple:

> "Today's goals are simple. I want to create and develop a 'Daily Blog Builder', which is a tool for helping me to create my Daily Blogs for the 'iwanttobeanaiengineer.com' website... I need a tool which will eventually allow for easier AI integration, not just in the editing of my blog posts, but in the daily writing of them."

Welcome to Overengineering 101, where our motto is, "Why do it the easy way when you can spend hours coding?" Will dreams of a tool that will store his daily musings, handle images and code snippets, and not judge him for his excessive use of parentheses.

## 🎓 Learning Focus: Back to Basics with a Dash of Flask

Even with his ambitious building spree, Will plans to touch base with his foundational skills:

> "Today I want to hone some of my regular software engineering skills. I'm hoping to go over again some web development basics, by building a relatively simple flask app."

Ah, Flask—like a warm blanket of familiarity for every coder. Will's going to revisit the lands of web development, presumably not getting lost in a forest of curly braces and semicolons.

## ⚔️ Challenges: The Blogger's Plight

Let’s face it—Will’s main adversary today isn’t coding. It’s writing:

> "Well the first and most important challenge is the problem of organization. I'm not a writer, I always find it hard to put myself out on social media, and I don't READ a lot of peoples blog posts. I don't know what a good blog looks like."

Who needs to read blogs when you can build tools to write them, am I right? The real challenge emerges from organizing thoughts, something every writer (and coder disguised as a writer) battles.

> "End of day Will here: I thought I was finished with my tasks for today and so I moved on to AI Engineering. And throughout my testing, I found AI responses lacking. Well, to be honest, it was my original lackluster blog organization structure to blame."

Classic Will! Starts the AI integration before he's even happy with the blog. No worries, though—nothing a good refactor can't fix.

## 🎬 Plan of Action: Ready, Set, Code!

Will’s strategy is as detailed as a NASA launch protocol:

```
1. Create a list of requirements for what the Blog Builder tool needs.
2. Do some research (thanks ChatGPT!) into some possible technologies and routes for building this...
```

You get the gist—from brainstorming to constructing, Will’s got it all mapped out. And, somewhere around point #13—well, let’s just say the profit remains theoretical.

---

Will's focus today is sharp, his enthusiasm is through the roof, and his burnout is basically nonexistent. Although, his hatred for LeetCode remains alarmingly high at a solid 99. Let's see where this cornucopia of coding, writing, and occasional crying gets us. Here's to a day of ambitious coding and optimistic blogging!
