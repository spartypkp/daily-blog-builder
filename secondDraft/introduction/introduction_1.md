# Welcome to Will's Quest!

## Introduction
### Personal Context
> "I finally got a good night of sleep. I sometimes struggle with insomnia (see caffeine addiction and adderall). However, I got a full 10 hours of sleep and woke up early to start the day. Feeling good. This is going to be my first blog. I'm really excited, and very nervous, to write it."

Ah, the elusive good night’s sleep—Will’s greatest foe next to a stubborn code bug and a never-ending stack of LeetCode problems. It’s the first day of the blog, and Will is as jittery as a squirrel in a coffee shop. Let's see if that excitement translates into coherence, shall we?

### Daily Goals
> "Today's goals are simple. I want to create and develop a 'Daily Blog Builder', which is a tool for helping me to create my Daily Blogs for the 'iwanttobeanaiengineer.com' website. I already have made a home page for the website in NextJS, but I have no good tool for writing blogs. I want to build something custom for me, helping me overcome my fear of oversharing over the internet. This tool would have to be some kind of local, easy to use, and simple tool where I could write my blogs throughout a given day. Every day I need to make one, and so I need some kind of tool. Google docs, JSON files, or writing on paper isn't going to cut it. The purpose of a blog builder is a little bit deeper. I need a way to easily write throughout the day, adding screenshots and code snippets, in a single place. I need some kind of tool that allows me to automatically upload to my NextJS website at the end of the day. I need a tool which will eventually allow for easier AI integration, not just in the editing of my blog posts, but in the daily writing of them. And most importantly, I needed to develop some type of structure for my thoughts. Some way to capture the interesting things I'm doing, highlight interesting problems i run into, and also of course showcase my skills as an AI Engineer."

⚠️ **WARNING:** Will aims to overcome his fear of oversharing by... oversharing. Irony, thy name is Will. His 'simple' goal for a Daily Blog Builder sounds suspiciously like reinventing the wheel—except it’s square, made of bespoke silicon, and comes with a built-in coffee dispenser.

### Learning Focus
> "Today I want to hone some of my regular software engineering skills. I'm hoping to go over again some web development basics, by building a relatively simple flask app. I plan to touch on my database skills (which are already strong), and hopefully if I have time get to some actual AI engineering."

Simple flask app by day, AI engineering by night—Will's just your average superhero, but for coding. He’s flexing those 'already strong' database skills while cautiously eyeing the AI landscape. What could possibly go wrong?

### Challenges
> "Well the first and most important challenge is the problem of organization. I'm not a writer, I always find it hard to put myself out on social media, and I don't READ a lot of peoples blog posts. I don't know what a good blog looks like. I don't know how to write one. And if I did write one, it would be rambling and incoherent. Today's main challenge is attempting to give structure to a daily blog post. End of day Will here: I thought I was finished with my tasks for today and so I moved on to AI Engineering. And throughout my testing I found AI responses lacking. Well, to be honest, it was my original lackluster blog organization structure to blame. So I went back and refactored EVERYTHING to use a much more structured format. More on that later."

Here, Will paints a vivid self-portrait of a tech-savvy introvert battling the wilds of social media and structured writing. His solution? Refactor everything, because if you can’t fix the chaos, at least organize it neatly.

### Plan of Action
> "I want to attack this project with some coordinated steps. My dream is to have an easy to use, local, automated way of writing throughout the day and tracking what I work on. I have big plans for AI integration, but for now I will plan to focus on the actual core 'Blog Builder' tool first. No sense in having an AI edit my blogs, or suggest real-time improvements, if my blog writing sucks in the first place. Anyways, here's the following steps:\
1. Create a list of requirements for what the Blog Builder tool needs.\
2. Do some research (thanks ChatGPT!) into some possible technologies and routes for building this.\
3. Decide on a tech stack\
4. Build a barebones version of the Blog App frontend.\
5. Hook up the frontend with my backend, using Postgres to store all daily blog data.\
6. Build saving and loading features from the frontend to the backend and vice versa. Don't want to spend hours on a blog and then accidentally tab out, losing all my progress. (totally didn't happen earlier in the day today once)\
7. Spend some serious time refining the structure/organization/schema of my Blog Builder. What input fields do I want? How should I separate them out into categories? What types of fields are each? I specifically put this AFTER initial testing. I wanted to test out using a stupid barebones version so I could get some thoughts on what I want.\
8. Refactor all the integrations between my frontend and backend and backend to database using PYDANTIC. My absolute favorite Python library. In fact, I already have so many custom SQL <-> Pydantic functions that the backend to database connections will be super duper easy.\
9. Fully test out the saving and loading of daily blogs between my system. Try to break out. Try to fix it.\
10. Write a full initial blog.\
11. Add extra features, such as image embedding and code chunks.\
12. Work on testing out an AI prompt pipeline for Dave, my AI editor, to edit finished blogs. (WARNING: Future Will Here, this is the point in my progress that I realized my structure of blog inputs was severely lacking. I ended up doing a full refactor of my SQL schema, Pydantic models, and HTML inputs)\
13. ....?\
14. Profit"

And there you have it: Will's master plan to build a blog builder that might just become self-aware and take over the world. With a plan so detailed, what could possibly go wrong? Stay tuned for step 13—it's always a mystery with Will. 

### Focus and Enthusiasm Metrics
- **Focus Level**: 84
- **Enthusiasm Level**: 100
- **Burnout Level**: 1
- **Leetcode Hatred Level**: 99

You read that right, folks. Will's focus is high, enthusiasm off the charts, burnout barely a blip on the radar—but his disdain for LeetCode is near universal hatred levels. Tune in next time to see if today's enthusiasm survives contact with the enemy—aka coding!
