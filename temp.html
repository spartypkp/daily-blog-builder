<p id="task_progress_notes-0">My day started out by thinking about a list of requirements for the blog builder. I
    already detailed these requirements in the daily goals. I jumped right into research with ChatGPT, my favorite
    partner programming rubber ducky. After discussing with ChatGPT, it became clear that Flask would probably be the
    best choice. It would allow me the most flexibility and speed to MVP. I wanted something simple, and this would do
    the trick. I can use Python for my entire backend, while also using Pydantic models to pass data in a more
    structured way. I already extensively use Pydantic when interacting with SQL tables, and imported some of my common
    used functions. The function I show below is a simple generic python function for writing a select query on a given
    table, and returning all results as a List of pydantic models. Provide the table name, and the Pydantic type you
    want returned, and bam it works. It is considered bad practice to use Python f string formatting to inject the table
    name directly, however I don't care.<span class="inline-block">

            message="Well, when Will says 'I don't care,' he really means, 'Please don’t try this at home unless you love debugging security issues at midnight.'"
            preface=""></warning>
    </span> I will always be manually specifying the table name, which is never derived from user input. I have some
    experimental versions of this function which use more safe Psycopg3 parameterized inputs, but that's still in
    development. I currently have separate functions for all the main SQL query types. In the future, I hope to finish
    my work on developing a generic function and library for interacting with SQL purely through Pydantic Models (which
    can be auto generated!). This will likely be a future blog post, so stick around!</p>

<p id="task_progress_notes-3">As I was looking for that pydantic_select function, I realized I have the same function
    defined in 10 different repositories.<span class="inline-block">

            preface=""></question>
    </span> Some are slightly different, with slight enhancements and changes I've made throuhgout my Pydantic journey.
    I really need to go back and standardize. I think I need a better system for versioning across repos. Putting a
    mental note to be a smarter software engineer and find a solution for that.</p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-4"><br /></p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-5">The next step is of course to design the schema and structure of a daily blog post. I need
    to decide on what information I need to capture each day in all my blogs. How do I want to go about designing this?
    I started this process by deciding to split a given single blog post into 3 separate sections. There's an
    introduction, which occurs at the beginning of each day, and contains information about my goals, description of the
    problem, plan of attack, and some other fun mood sliders. The last section is the reflection, where I can reflect on
    the progress of the day and how i did or did not achieve my goals. I struggled to come up with a solid idea for
    tracking my work during the bulk of the day, where I'm working on different projects and tasks for different amount
    of time. I could be working on scraping legislation, practicing leetcode, working my part time AI Engineer
    consulting job, or building numerous different side projects. I needed something flexible that allowed me to track
    multiple different unique tasks throughout the day.<span class="inline-block">
        <question
            message="Will, have you ever considered that your ‘flexible system’ is just a sneaky way to avoid making decisions? 😏"
            preface=""></question>
    </span> I decided on building a dynamic task system, where I could track progress for 1 to N number of tasks I
    complete during the day. How I break up my goals into tasks will be left completely up to me (for now, maybe I'll
    integrate Dave to help me later). Each task has information on the task, description, and tracks some important
    information like "Challenges Encountered" and "Research Questions".</p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-6"><br /></p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-7">The first step to implementing my blog schema is to structure my thoughts into you guessed
    it, a Pydantic model! And because I love Pydantic and Postgres so much, I can concurrently create the schema for my
    backend data and my database. I map Pydantic models directly into PostgreSQL table schemas. The trick is to use
    JSONB for complex nested fields, which the corresponding Pydantic model represents as another Pydantic model! This
    allows for rapid iteration of design. As long as I get some of the key metadata fields right, I can effortlessly
    update how I structure and store data without ever having to worry about updating SQL schema. This can be incredibly
    important when doing rapid prompt engineering. In this case, I've developed Pydantic models for the "Introduction",
    "Tasks", and "Reflection" sections of each Daily Blog. Those are represented as JSONB in SQL, and have their own
    submodels in Python. Here's the code!</p>

<p id="task_progress_notes-9">I really enjoy using the Field() feature of Pydantic, which allows me to set default
    values and add extensive descriptions, as well as constraints for improved automatic value validation.<span
        class="inline-block">
        <warning
            message="Watch out—when Will says 'extensive descriptions', he might just mean his usual rambling but in JSON format. 🤷‍♂️"
            preface=""></warning>
    </span> Also, I hope you see how I avoid using camelCase like the plague. I want the name of my Pydantic model
    fields to EXACTLY match the SQL column names. Now this naming, doesn't technically matter for submodels, which will
    be thrown into JSONB, but I like to be consistent. Speaking of JSONB, here's the SQL schema for the daily_blogs
    table!</p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-10"><br /></p>
<pre class="ql-syntax" id="task_progress_notes-11" spellcheck="false">CREATE TABLE daily_blogs (

    date date PRIMARY KEY,

    introduction jsonb,

    tasks jsonb,

    reflection jsonb,

    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),

    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()

);
</pre>
<p id="task_progress_notes-12">Shout out Postico, the best investment I ever made. As you can see, this table is
    brutally simple. I like to keep complex design and typing within the backend and out of the database. JSONB is great
    because it allows for incredible flexiblity in rapid iteration of schema, and I can still create complex SQL queries
    which access underlying data within JSONB columns. To my naive junior software development mind, this is an
    acceptable tradeoff. I love it.</p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-13"><br /></p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-14">I now need to set up my backend, super simple at first. I'm using Flask, and only need a
    couple of main routes.</p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-15">My file system structure is stupid simple, and took me and ChatGPT about 5 minutes to
    setup.</p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-16"><img src="/static/uploads/Screenshot_2024-09-06_at_1.17.11_PM.png"
        style="width: 30%; height: auto;" /></p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-17"><br /></p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-18">I've got a super simple setup here. I've got a home route, which gets the current blog
    for the day or creates an empty one, and then renders the home page with it.</p>
<ul id="task_progress_notes-19">
    <li>/api/today_blog route offers up the daily blog. It's useful because my Javascript function will ask for the
        daily blog to populate all of the daily tasks dynamically. I'm just now noticing it has a /api/ in the route.
        Bad ChatGPT, that's completely unnecessary.</li>
    <li>/submit_blog reads in the values of all my forms and text areas for a daily blog, loads it into a Pydantic
        model, and then saves it to Postgres. Simple.</li>
    <li>/upload_image is a route that handles the saving of image uploads into the repository. This is necessary to
        override the default functionality of Quill, a rich text editor for Javascript.</li>
</ul>
<p id="task_progress_notes-20">Next it was necessary to start working on the frontend. To be honest, I worked
    simultaneously on the frontend as I was building out some of the functionality of the API routes. But for easier
    understanding, I'm talking about these two separately. First step was to start building out the frontend. I started
    by prompting ChatGPT to develop 3 distinct sections of content in the body, as well as set up Tailwind and the rest
    of the HTML document. There are 3 distinct sections corresponding to the Pydantic Model: introduction, tasks, and of
    course reflection. Here's an image of a VERY early version of the frontend.</p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-21"><img src="/static/uploads/Screenshot_2024-09-05_at_10.09.28_AM.png"
        style="width: 30%; height: auto;" /></p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-22"><br /></p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-23">After some iteration, I was able to fully flesh out the correct input areas for ALL of
    the fields of the Pydantic model. I was very careful to make the ID of each input element the exact field name of
    the Pydantic model, to allow for super easy access. Smort. To be completely honest, this is the point where a lot of
    design iteration happened.<span class="inline-block">
        <warning message="‘Smort’. Will trying to make ‘smart’ sound cool, or a typo? You decide!" preface=""></warning>
    </span> I redesigned my Pydantic model a lot. I added new fields. I tested out new HTML. At this point I even
    started to write a partial blog. However, this blog eventually had to be overwritten, as I made simply too much
    radical changes to the Pydantic model schema and SQL table, and opted to simply restart. So if you feel as if I'm
    extra omnitient in this blog, that's why! I really do want to focus on writing the blogs more as I go, but I'll cut
    myself some slack as this is my first blog. Also, it's very difficult to use a tool which you are in the process of
    developing. So cut me some slack Dave. Here's a finalized version of the current introduction section, filled with
    text I am currently writing for the blog.</p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-24"><img src="/static/uploads/Screenshot_2024-09-06_at_1.37.40_PM.png"
        style="width: 30%; height: auto;" /></p>
<p id="task_progress_notes-25">My next step was to connect my frontend with my backend. I needed to write a bunch of
    different scripts, which would handle data loading between my backend. Possibly the most important function is the
    initializeBlog() function. This function takes in a Pydantic model of the blog data, dumped to JSON, and uses it to
    set the html of all my data input HTML elements. Simple, but works. And because I made the id of each element to map
    directly to my Pydantic model field names, it's super clean and easy. After adding all of the introduction and
    reflection sections, I have to iterate over all of the possible daily tasks and generate those separately. Onward!

<p id="task_progress_notes-31">If you're a smarter person than me, you'll instantly see a problem with this approach.
    Although much more elegant, there's a slight problem. What happens when there's not an already initialized blog for
    the day?? Well, to handle this I would initialize an empty Pydantic model in my backend, if there wasn't already a
    row in the database for today's blog. The problem is that I set the default value for the tasks field to an empty
    list. In the above script, it iterates through the 'blogData.tasks.length'. Well that would be 0, and an empty task
    would never be added for the beautiful writer to populate. I could write a separate function to create a fallback
    task HTML generation? No, that's dumb. I went for the simple approach of changing the Pydantic model code. The
    'task' submodel has all optional fields, and all of their defaults are already set (empty strings, or some number
    for numeric). An 'empty' task submodel could simply be initialized automatically, if there's no data present. So I
    changed one single line of my Pydantic file: I made a default_factory with a lambda to simply initialize a list,
    with an empty Task model, if no value was provided. Done. Everything worked. Seriously, that's the solution. I love
    Pydantic.</p>

<p id="task_progress_notes-33">That's about the end of the daily work. To recap, I've done some thinking work to decide
    on what my blog should look like, I did some research and decided on a tech stack, I iterated on a Pydantic model
    and SQL schema concurrently, built a super basic Flask backend, connected it to my database with my custom Pydantic
    functions, iterated on a relatively simple frontend, and then built some javascript scripts to read in data of a
    blog and populate the fields! I spent some time testing out Quill, which is a rich text editor, which is what allows
    me to embed pictures and code chunks into this text! I think I'm ready to move on to the next task, which in reality
    is finishing the blog (I have some retroactive writing to do, now that "Blog Builder" is usable"). See you in the
    reflection!</p>
